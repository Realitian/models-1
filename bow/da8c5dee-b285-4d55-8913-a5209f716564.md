# bow

Bags of features, extracted in july 2018 from 7.8 million distinct files from PGA (taking only the `HEAD` commit), using all implemented extractors in `sourced.ml` at the time (`identifiers`, `literals`, `graphlets`, `children`, `node2vec` and `uast2seq`) and all languages parsable by Babelfish (Go, Java, Python, Bash, JavaScript and Ruby). This was done to try to use [apollo](https://github.com/src-d/apollo) at scale. We hit `scipy.sparse` limits while trying to merge sparse matrices for all bags, so this is only one of three `BOW` model holding bags.

Example:

```
from sourced.ml.models import BOW
bow = BOW().load("da8c5dee-b285-4d55-8913-a5209f716564")
print("Number of documents:", len(bow))
print("Number of tokens:", len(bow.tokens))
```
