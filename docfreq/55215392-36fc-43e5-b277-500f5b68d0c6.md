# docfreq

Bags of features, extracted in july 2018 from 7.8 million distinct files from PGA (taking only the `HEAD` commit), using all implemented extractors in `sourc    ed.ml` at the time (`identifiers`, `literals`, `graphlets`, `children`, `node2vec` and `uast2seq`) and all languages parsable by Babelfish (Go, Java, Python, Bash, JavaScript and Ruby). The document frequency here refers to the frequency of each feature across all documents (we only kept features that appeared at least 5 times).

Example:

```
from sourced.ml.models import OrderedDocumentFrequencies
df = OrderedDocumentFrequencies().load("55215392-36fc-43e5-b277-500f5b68d0c6")
print("Number of documents:", len(df))
```
